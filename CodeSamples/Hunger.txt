In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlaying districts.
 The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one girl and one boy between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, 
 a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she is forced to represent her district in the Games. But Katniss has also resolved to outwit the creators of the games.
To do that she will have to be the last person standing at the end of the deadly ordeal,
 and that will take every ounce of strength and cunning she has.
